Tasks

Basic Ratio Comparison
1. Build functionality that can read the current stock price - Done
2. Build functionality to compare to a DB value
3. Build functionality to create a report of all current status
4. Scrape financial information  - This is harder than I thought. I need to learn how to POST and retrieve comsec information from behind a portal. Yahoo doesn't seem scrapable and the CSV service doesn't provide financial data.
5. Get Current stock codes - Done

#Can any of this be found online?
